Tracker
===================================================================================================
>This web app built on the MERN tech stack will track your and multiple users' location in real time

## National Park Meetup

**Problem Statement**
- Design an application which tracks mobile device users as they move through a set of known locations, for example, all National Parks.
- This data would be sent to your application in near real-time with a user and location tuple.
- The level of design should be sufficient for passing off to a more junior engineer for implementation.

**Requirements are as follows:**

>**User Needs**
>- Where is the user currently?
>- What other users are nearby
>
>**Additional Requirements**
>- A user can only be at exactly one location at a given time.
>- A user can only be at a location for a period of 1 hour. If the user has not moved to a new location within that time frame, they shall be placed in an inactive state.
>- The application must use a non-volatile storage engine.
>
>**Expected deliverables**
>- Design documentation for the application. This should be provided as pdfs, pngs, and/or jpegs.
>- Implementation for some portion of the application. It is up to you which portion you implement. One suggestion is the user management logic, but feel free to implement another area if it would be more interesting to you. Your implementation should be provided as a zip file containing your project repository (using the VCS of your choice). The zip file should include any build files and non-publicly available libraries required to build your solution.
>- (Optional, but strongly encouraged) verification of your implementation. This could be unit tests, functional tests, etc. which are included in the project zip file discussed above.
>
>**Time frame**
>- In order to respect your time, we have tried to constrain this problem to something that could be adequately addressed in about four hours. You may use this time however you wish, but here is a suggested breakdown:  
>   - Design - 2 hours
>   - Implementation - 1 hour
>   - Test - 1 hour
>
>**Ground Rules**
>- You are free to communicate your design in whatever way you feel is effective, but please provide it in a format that does not require specific tools. The following file formats are preferred: pdf, jpeg, or png
>- You may utilize any mechanism for feeding input into your solution (for example, using hard-coded data within a unit test or a public data feed).
>- If warranted, we highly recommend using a unit testing framework such as JUnit.
Additionally, you should use the build and version control (VCS) tools of your choice. Please include all build files and VCS files when submitting the solution.
>- Please refrain from sharing your design and solutions on public repository hosts like GitHub and SourceForge. If you are having challenges figuring out a suitable method to submit your solution, ask your interviewers.
>- You may use other outside resources such as search engines, frameworks, library documentation, or CTI personnel. Please refrain from asking other developers or friends for help solving the coding problem.
>- If you do re-use code from elsewhere (for example Stack Overflow), please cite the usage.
>- The code you write should be of production quality, including relevant documentation to explain your solution, and most importantly, it should be code of which you are proud.
>- Be creative, have fun with your solution, and ask questions!
>  
>**Bonus Questions**
>- How would your program scale with many thousands of users? Can you modify your design for other key system considerations?
>- How would you determine bottlenecks?
>- How might you handle additional mobile platforms with disparate API's?
